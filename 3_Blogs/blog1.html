          <p>
            This is a very long paper, summarising it briefly will take a while
            and for this I am sorry to anyone who reads this critical writing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Turing begins his paper with a simple question: "Can machines
            think?" However, he points out that this would require specific
            definitions for the words "machines" and "think", which would be
            different from how people would usually use these words, which would
            turn into a very convoluted philosophical discussion and would then
            be pointless. As a solution to this, Turing proposes a game, an
            imitation game. To very briefly summarise the game we have three
            parties. Party A and B, where A is a machine and B is a person and
            party C, an interrogator who must determine which party is the
            machine and which party is the human. The interrogator asks
            questions and each party can respond using typewritten text. The
            goal of the machine, A, is to convince the interrogator that they
            are the person and the person is the machine, the goal of the
            person, B, is to convince the interrogator to give the correct
            outcome, that the machine is the machine and the person is the
            person. If a machine can effectively convince the outside
            interrogator, C, that they are in fact human, they have succeeded in
            the imitation game. Therefore, the machine has been able to mimic a
            person, the machine can learn the behavior of a human and therefore
            the machine can think.
          </p>
          <p>
            Turing is using this imitation game as a replacement for "think" in
            his question, now he tries to define what a "machine" is. Obviously,
            in the year 1950, there are limitations to computers, but Turing
            believes that in the future these limitations will be overcome by
            advancements in engineering and programming. For now, Turing has
            access to machines and computers that can only exist in one state
            and they have limited storage capacity. Turing proposes that the
            "machine" is his question is a digital computer with an infinite
            capacity for storage. By digital computer, Turing means that this is
            a machine that can carry out the operations of a human-computer (the
            human brain). The digital computer should consist of a store, an
            executive unit, and control. The store is of course storage
            capacity, to store answers and questions, the executive unit carries
            out the operations of the programs and the control ensures that the
            operations are carried out in the correct order. Turing points out
            that this is definitely not a new idea, ideas of digital computers
            go way back to the early 1800s when a mathematician proposed an
            "Analytical Machine" which would be able to "think". There were
            plans for this machine but it was never built, which Turing thinks
            is a very good thing because if it was built it would have been
            devastatingly and unbearably slow, perhaps a thousand times slower
            than The Manchester Machine, the first electronic computer that was
            built, which was already slow in Turing's opinion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Turing believes that in fifty years after the date of writing this
            paper, digital computers would be able to play the imitation game
            with over a thirty percent chance of winning against a human
            interrogator and another human party. This is incorrect, we do not
            have computers as of yet that can win Turing's "imitation game". We
            cannot say for sure though that we never will, however, I will
            continue with thought this after my summary of this very long paper.
          </p>
          <p>
            Turing is a man of science, in science it is always appropriate to
            consider views that are opposed to your own. This helps to challenge
            your own argument and in doing so can make it firmer or point out
            obvious flaws. Turing lays out nine arguments to his proposal "can
            machines think?" I am going to attempt to summarise all the
            arguments as briefly as possible and try to present the specific
            meanings of each argument as concisely as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first argument, "The Theological Question": God has given humans
            an immortal soul and the ability to think, unlike unworthy animals
            and machines, so we should not fathom denying his awesome will by
            giving machines the power to think. Turing believes that this
            argument is not valid, many philosophers and men of science have
            pointed out that trying to argue with questions like this is
            ultimately pointless in the various scientific fields and people who
            hold this argument will likely never change their beliefs. It is
            unsatisfactory. Turing, being a man of science and argument, does
            try to give a theological response to the question, it is very
            convoluted, I will not summarise it. His point made is clear.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second argument, "The Heads in the Sand Objection": the
            possibility of machines being able to think is far too scary, the
            consequences could be devasting and dreadful and so we will hope and
            believe that it will never happen. Turing believes this argument
            stems from the "humans are obviously the most superior very best
            race on the planet and anything that could challenge this
            superiority is scary and so we will not think about it too much".
            This argument, Turing points out, is very similar to the theological
            question and is, therefore, under very much on the same grounds,
            invalid.
          </p>
          <p>
            The third argument, "The Mathematical Objection": mathematical logic
            and theory can show that a computer is limited by algorithms and how
            they are made, they are limited, logically, in a way that human
            brains are not limited. Therefore a computer can never mimic a
            human. Finally, an argument Turing kind of accepts, however, Turing
            points out that human brains are limited, by things like storage
            capacity and the way humans tend to make mistakes and all that,
            perhaps in the future, the advancement of technology can remove the
            limitations to computers, even though for now this mathematical
            objection holds, it cannot predict the future of computing
            advancements. Turing believes that those who believe in the
            mathematical objection would be open to further scientific
            discussions on this matter, unlike those who hold the previous two
            objections.
          </p>

          <p>
            The fourth, fifth, and sixth arguments, "The Argument from
            Consciousness, Arguments from Various Disabilities and Lady
            Lovelace's Objection": I have combined these three arguments, in my
            opinion, they are all kind of the same. The overlying argument
            across these three arguments are: Computers are not conscious, they
            can't do stuff like write poetry or feel emotions or enjoy
            strawberries and cream, they can't possibly learn new things,
            everything has to be programmed into them by a human. They are
            fundamentally different from us beautiful, flawed creatures. They
            can't even write sonnets, how absurd. Turing has basically the same
            response to all these objections, how does this invalidate his
            theory, his question? Can machines think? There are people who can't
            write sonnets, people are different in different ways and they still
            think. Not everyone likes strawberries and cream. These arguments
            are all kind of strange and there often isn't a concrete scientific
            reason to be asking these questions. Computers can, in fact, learn
            new things, just because they learn new things from sets of data and
            principles does not make them inferior to biological beings that
            learn from the environment. These are all arguments that lead to the
            statement that, well, computers are not biological beings, they
            don't have a biological consciousness, they could never truly have
            one, but Turing responds by saying, how does this stop them from
            thinking, really? How would this stop them from successfully
            learning to mimic a human in his imitation game? Another example
            was, well, machines simply cannot make mistakes. It is impossible
            for them to make mistakes in the way that humans do all the time,
            Turing responds by asking why should we fault machines for this. Why
            do we think making mistakes makes us superior and fundamentally
            better than machines? It is an interesting observation, probably
            also stemming from the "humans are just the best most dominant
            species on this planet and we are superior to everything else, do
            not challenge us" complex.
          </p>

          <p>
            The seventh argument, "Argument from Continuity in the Nervous
            System": humans have a very complicated nervous system, where a
            small signal that is in error can lead to mistakes and missteps in a
            human's behavior. A machine does not have something like this.
            Turing agrees, yes this is true, but this can be fixed by just
            introducing a small random margin of error in the machine.
            Therefore, the argument can be invalidated in the circumstances of
            the imitation game.
          </p>

          <p>
            The eighth argument, "The Argument from Informality of Behaviour":
            we cannot produce a set of rules or predictions for every possible
            outcome in a person's experiences. People are not governed by laws
            in the way that machines have to be. Therefore, humans can not be
            the same as machines in the context of this imitation game. Turing
            accepts this and then disagrees. Humans are in fact governed by laws
            and rules. There is a large, predictable possibility of a person
            driving stopping at a red stoplight. There is an even larger
            predictable possibility of a person displaying discomfort when you
            harm them. If you look at a person in a situation and try to
            fundamentally say there are no rules governing this person's
            reactions and movements, you would be fundamentally wrong. Humans do
            abide by rules and laws, whether they are biological or created by
            society. Sometimes they can be broken, but there are still rules.
            Therefore, perhaps we are not so different from machines.
          </p>

          <p>
            The ninth argument: "The Argument from Extrasensory Perception":
            well what if telepaths are real? They could just read the mind of
            the human and win the game. That is very true, Turing replies, he
            will not exclude this possibility, we should introduce then a
            telepathy proof room for the game.
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, after all these arguments Turing speaks about his idea of
            learning machines. Many people would assume to start a machine from
            the state of an adult human. What if, Turing proposes, we replace
            this idea with starting a machine at the point of a child. In a
            person's life, there are three states we go through, the initial
            state at birth where we know nothing, our formal education and then
            our experiences outside of education. Could we not replicate this in
            a machine? Have the machine begin at a very minimal state, birth,
            and then find a way to teach the machine formally with education
            from a teacher. The fact that a machine cannot see or hear should
            not impede this, there are humans like this who can still learn with
            information being fed to them in different methods, see: Helen
            Keller. We could introduce a punishment and reward system for
            machines where punishments mean: "do this less often" and rewards
            mean: "do this more often" and now we can have machine learning
            through experiences. We have a machine that can learn and grow,
            similar to a human. Could this machine therefore think? Could this
            machine win the imitation game?
          </p>

          <p>
            Turing ends with a very poignant quote: "We can only see a short
            distance ahead, but we can see plenty that needs to be done."
          </p>

          <p>
            After this brief and concise overview of this wonderful paper, there
            are two ideas that I want to explore. The first is how it often
            seems that humans very much have a superiority complex, over
            machines and any other animal. We believe that because we can think
            very critically, we can make technological advancements we can
            explore science so deeply, we can write poetry and we can do such
            wonderful things, we so much better than anything we could ever
            create and we are better than all other creatures that exist. But we
            are so imperfect and flawed and destructive. We are the superpowered
            villains on this planet, we are actively destroying it. Why would we
            be better than a machine with artificial intelligence that can think
            just because we have some kind of nature-given consciousness that we
            have abused so terribly? On this point, how are we also better than
            animals, animals that are often just trying to exist and survive and
            enjoy their lives in their own circumstances and why do we always
            feel the need to disrupt them, to harm them, to hunt them, to mass
            breed thousands of them in factories to eat them, to confine them,
            to destroy their habitats and their homes. Why do humans believe we
            are so superior? That went off on a bit of a tangent, but I believe
            this is something fundamental to humanity and ethics and the things
            that we create. We are afraid to be challenged by anything, we are
            afraid to be anything other than the dominant species. Are we afraid
            of creating a machine that can think for itself? Are we afraid of
            creating something better than us, is this why there are so many
            powerful oppositions to the very simple question "can machines
            think?"
          </p>

          <p>
            The second idea is that final quote, we can only see a short
            distance ahead, what our science can do. This is true, twenty years
            ago even scientists would not be have been able to fathom some of
            the technology we have now, but those scientists knew that there was
            a lot that needed to be done, the same goes for fifty years ago.
            However, there are so many hopes for the future that were never
            realized. Science fiction was always speaking about the years in the
            2000s as being full of marvels and wonders and space travel and
            infinitely renewable energy, how disappointed would they be that
            even with all our science and technology we could not even handle a
            pandemic with good results. We know that there is a lot to be done
            in terms of science, computer engineering, programming - the things
            that I am interested in. And the short distance that we see ahead of
            us is not one of hope and wonder, we are facing disasters at every
            turn. Climate change is too far gone for us to stop it, the
            consequences are already rearing their heads. And truly, we can see
            that we will need to do a lot as programmers, as engineers and as
            artists, that there is very much a lot that needs to be done. "We
            can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty that
            needs to be done." I believe that in our profession this quote
            should stand as both a statement of hope and wonder with what the
            future holds, but also a warning that there are things we have to
            repair, to prevent, to prepare for, for that wonderful future to
            come to pass.
          </p>

            Thank you for reading my critical summary and then the response to
            Turing's interesting paper on computing machinery and intelligence.
            I am so sorry this was very long.
