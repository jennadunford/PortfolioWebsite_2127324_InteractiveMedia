            Defining Interactivity in terms of the WWW
          </h4>
          <p>
            The Oxford dictionary defines interactivity in terms of computing as
            allowing information to be passed to and from a computer and another
            person or device. My own perception of something being interactive
            in the space of website design and the world wide web is a design
            that accommodates the choices of the user and how the user would
            like to perceive and navigate through information on the internet.
            Having a web page that is only a wall of text that the user can
            scroll through is not interactive in the space of this definition.
            However, breaking up that wall of text into different web pages and
            allowing the user to choose which pages they would like to visit
            does incorporate interactivity. Allowing users to post public
            comments on web pages allows for interactivity, as well as allowing
            for content to be changed to accommodate the user, increasing text
            size, changing colors on the web page, and so forth. You give the
            user a sense of choice and agency in how they choose to navigate a
            website and the internet.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">
            What Does Interactivity Mean for Design on the WWW
          </h4>
          <p>
            Fundamentally, designers and developers need to take into account
            that people expect their digital experiences to be interactive.
            However, every person will have a slightly different idea of what
            interactive means, and how they can benefit from what they perceive
            to be interactive. A learning experience for children may need to be
            a literal gamified interactive experience, where there are lots of
            ways for a child to experience information on a web page for their
            own learning and entertainment experience - buttons, browser games,
            changing page elements. A social media site user will expect to use
            the website to share their views and experiences with other users,
            react to other users' posts, and decide what information they would
            like to see for their experience. Perhaps all a website needs to be
            interactive is to have different pages and allow users to choose
            which pages they would like to see, through links and buttons.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">
            What Does Interactivity Mean for Users on the WWW
          </h4>
          <p>
            Through the usage of digital technology and exploration of the WWW,
            users have begun to expect a certain level of interactivity from
            websites and from their internet experience. Fundamentally,
            interaction requires at least a small bit of input from somewhere,
            to provide the output that is interactive. And so, in an interactive
            WWW users always expect to give input. Users type in searches, users
            browse products, users navigate web spaces in their own ways, all
            this interactivity can lead to data being collected about users -
            profiles being built around them - and so targeted ads can be shown
            to the users, social media sites can intentionally show users
            content they know they will enjoy and hide content that they don't.
            Because of how interactivity is prevalent on the world wide web,
            users should start being more vigilant about how websites are
            asking, or are accomodating, them to interact with them. Would users
            be willing to sacrifice the feeling of deep interactivity in the WWW
            experiences for their privacy? A great perception people have of
            interactivity is choice, you may choose to do whatever you like
            instead of you must do exactly what a website wants you to do.
            However, there is the chance that all these choices are simply
            leading the user to the outcome that the designer wanted from the
            user in the first place. Users with two different perceptions on a
            topic could navigate a website with interactivity and leave with the
            same experience of the topic, as the website would have wanted,
            while there is the illusion of a choice, it is usually just a way to
            manipulate users through design. Think about a website that wants to
            pitch a product to both liberal and conservative users, through
            interactivity, they could lead both parties to the same conclusion
            on the product, but through different avenues with web
            interactivity. It is an interesting thing to think about,
            interactivity can certainly improve experiences, but there are of
            course ways to utilize it in not-so-ethical manners - as it is with
            many technologies.
