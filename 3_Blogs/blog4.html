          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">1. Introduction</h4>
          <p>
            Relying on a breakdown of the text, "Towards a Study of Information
            Technologies", this report will discuss the aims, methodology,
            results, and the conclusions of the text. Additional research will
            also be done to compare, analyse, and discuss differences and
            similarities between other pieces of literature on the subject. For
            the scope of the report, the entire text should be broken down as
            concisely as possible, and a required amount of other pieces of
            research needed to understand the different thought methodologies of
            this field will be used and referenced. This report is intended to
            provide a critical discussion and analysis of the problems
            presented.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">2. Breakdown of Text</h4>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">
            2.1 Text Introduction: Information Geographies and (im)mutable
            Augmentations
          </h4>
          <p>
            [1] The introduction to the text introduces the concept that
            information has geography, meaning information will always be
            somehow connected to places and between places. Information also
            always exists physically, whether on books and paper or on internet
            servers. Information also moves. The article emphasizes that these
            conventions for information have not changed in the digital age, the
            core principles of information mentioned before still very much
            apply to the world today. The principle of immutable information
            means that when information is transported between places there is
            no significant change to the core meanings of the information.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the digital age, technology has now facilitated a concept that
            the article calls (im)mutable augmentations, where information is
            layered dynamically across geographic spaces, and this information
            itself becomes changed and moulded and has influences on the
            geography where the information originated. The information is
            mutable and immutable. This (im)mutable augmentation of information
            allows people to access geographic and other forms of information
            during geographic activities, i.e. travelling through spaces. The
            consequence of this is that places that have not been catalogued in
            internet spaces can become invisible to people. The way places are
            represented on the internet can also affect how they are viewed by
            people. The emergence of geographic information being unleashed into
            the digital age has made geographic information more than simply a
            representation of space. The geographic information and how it is
            presented can and will have direct, material effects on the places
            represented, and unrepresented.
          </p>
          <p>
            The article states that it intends to explore information
            geographies and their distributions, access, participation, and
            representation.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">2.2 Pre-Digital Pieces of Information</h4>
          <p>
            Before the digital age information was scarce and very
            geographically dependent. Tools for the creation and distribution of
            information collections were held by small groups of people.
            Large-scale data collection was rare. Books, where information was
            largely stored, had limited access for the general public and there
            was limited access to their production. Access to information was
            also controlled by the formats that were chosen to display
            information, that could only be understood by those with the
            appropriate training.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another hindrance to information accessibility were the required
            skillsets needed to create, organize, catalogue, and store
            information on a large scale. Due to this need, institutions such as
            universities were created, however, access to these institutions
            would be limited still to most people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to power relations around the world, it was more common for
            information to be created and accessed in the global North while the
            global South suffered a vast lack of access to information and the
            creation of information. Information was very much controlled by
            power, systems of governance, and global areas of inequality.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">
            2.3 Changing Geographies after the Information Revolution
          </h4>
          <p>
            In recent years, the dawn of the digital age, there have been large
            changes in the availability of information. These changes have been
            created through the increased access to computers and the internet
            which allows people with access to view, create, share and organize
            information on a large scale. In essence, many barriers that existed
            in the pre-digital era of information have been removed.
          </p>
          <p>
            There has been a lot of talk about how the digital age has removed
            all restrictions on information, however, this is not such a simple
            idea. Just because there are ways to have basically unlimited access
            to information, does not mean that this exists for everyone. People
            and information are still restricted and bound by geographical
            circumstances. What would be a good method of investigating this and
            finding a way to prove that geographies of the global population
            changes how information is created, accessed and shared?
          </p>
          <p>
            The article suggests that three topics be explored, researched and
            discussed in detail:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Geographies of Access and Enablement</li>
            <li>Geographies of Participation</li>
            <li>Geographies of Representation</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            All of these topics will be mapped out using data sets, and then
            discussed. The article notes that the methods of data collection
            will not be a wholly accurate representation of information
            geographies across the world, due to limitations in how data can be
            found at this point in time. However, the information found should
            still be of value in painting a general picture of the current state
            of information geographies around the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            The article also raises the point that this research will create
            more questions than answers about global information geographies,
            however, this is the intention of the article. The authors want this
            paper to encourage more members of the academic community to
            explore, research, collect data and answer questions about this
            topic.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">2.4 Geographies of Access and Enablement</h4>
          <p>
            The article tells us that understanding the geographies of access
            and enabled will provide insights into the distribution of various
            technologies that are essential for people to engage with digital
            information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Internet access is the most important aspect of gaining access to
            digital information, therefore, it is important to illustrate
            world-wide patterns of connectivity. The article used data from the
            World Back that tracked internet users worldwide to create a mapped
            diagram showing where most internet users are situated.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data shows that the global North has overwhelmingly more
            internet users than the global South, displaying a lack of access to
            digital information for most of the world population.
          </p>
          <p>
            To further analyse the global distribution of internet users, the
            article notes another important aspect of digital accessibility,
            broadband affordability. The authors collected data from the
            International Telecommunication Union on the price of internet
            connection as a percentage of the average income of each country.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data was displayed on a map which showed that the global South
            had disproportionally high broadband prices compared to the global
            North. With regards to average salaries, it is much more expensive
            to access the internet in the global South, indicating a possible
            reason as to why internet users are so few in this part of the
            world.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">2.5 Geographies of Participation</h4>
          <p>
            An important part of access to digital information is participation
            in the creation and sharing of that information. The article uses
            three variables to measure the worldwide distribution of internet
            participants.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first variable is domain names, where the authors investigated
            the distribution of domain names by country, it was found that the
            United States and Europe has the highest percentage of domain names
            linked to their countries, again showing that the global North has a
            large, unequal share of internet participation in terms of domain
            names. The article states that a reason for this could be the
            regulations around domain names in various countries, in some
            countries there are stricter guidelines around registering domain
            names, which may prevent many internet users from accessing them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second variable is distributions of collaborative coding, this
            article used GitHub to collect data, the largest platform for
            internet users to publicly publish and collaborate on software
            development. Using the data available, the authors discovered that
            countries in the global North had far greater GitHub commits than
            the global South. This again shows that even the few with internet
            access in countries with low internet populations, those few do not
            engage with digital information on the same level that countries
            with high internet populations do.
          </p>
          <p>
            The third variable is the geography of Wikipedia contributions
            because Wikipedia is the largest encyclopaedia and allows all
            internet users to participate in information contributions and
            edits. Wikipedia also supports may different languages, allowing
            more accessibility. The Wikipedia contributions data shows that the
            continent of Africa as a whole as very few entries, exampled by the
            fact that Hong Kong alone has more Wikipedia edits than the entirety
            of Africa, this again displays the inequalities around internet
            access in Africa and the global North.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">2.6 Geographies of Representation</h4>
          <p>
            Geographies of representation aims to show which parts of the world
            are represented or underrepresented in the digital world. The
            article uses data from Google searches, OpenStreetMap and the
            Semantic Web to study this.
          </p>
          <p>
            The authors used Google search data to find which country names had
            the most results brought up. The analysed data reiterated the
            inequalities seen in earlier analyses that the article had conducted
            and shown.
          </p>
          <p>
            OpenStreetMap is the largest map of roads in the world, this is
            because of its open-source nature. Seeing which areas and places had
            the most comprehensive road data shows which areas are properly
            represented geographically and which countries are less represented.
            Again, the analysed data showed that the global North has much more
            geographical representation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The semantic web refers to actions taken to make the internet as a
            whole more accessible with data than can be reused easily on various
            services. This article focuses on the services of Freebase and
            Geonames. Freebase is a general knowledge database with millions of
            entries and Geobase is the largest directory of place names. Taking
            the data from these two services and mapping them out again shows
            the disparity shown in the previous analyses. There is much more
            representation in terms of digital information and representation in
            the global North than in the global South.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">
            2.7 Conclusions: Towards a Study of Information Geographies
          </h4>
          <p>
            From the review of geographies of digital access seen in the paper,
            it is clear that the view that the internet makes information
            accessible to everyone is a false one. There are very large parts of
            the world with little to no stake in the world of digital
            information access, contribution, and representation. Many facets of
            our society need to be addressed to fix these gaps in information
            geographies including attention to policy-making, post-colonial
            information governance and the infrastructures that are in place
            that limit digital access to large parts of the global population.
          </p>
          <p>
            This paper aims to encourage more research to be done into the data
            displayed and discussed so that the global community can better
            understand the issue at hand and find ways to make digital
            information geographies truly accessible to all.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">3. Aims</h4>
          <p>
            The aim of the summarized article was to conduct never-before-done
            research into the geographies of digital information in order to
            bring more understanding to the fact that there are large areas of
            our world where the concept of the internet being open and
            accessible to all does not exist. This is not a subject where much
            research was done before, and so this article also aims to open a
            new area of study in order to gain clearer understandings of the
            problems discussed in the paper.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another aim was to graphically show the disparity in digital
            information access, it's hard to relate plain numbers to the world,
            however showing the data depicted in maps shows the vast scale of
            information disparities. This is something that was not formally
            done before, according to the article.
          </p>

          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">4. Methodology</h4>
          <p>
            The methodology of the data collection in the article involved
            gathering information from various organizations and organizing the
            information so that it could be displayed geographically, or in a
            way to show relative size.
          </p>
          <p>
            The methodology used was effective, as it displayed the disparities
            in digital information access on a global scale in a digital manner,
            and graphically, which was also effective. However, the article does
            admit that this collection of data was nowhere near extensive enough
            and could not display smaller nuances in digital access across the
            world using only generalized datasets. In future research, more data
            should be collected at local scales, to better understand the
            smaller factors that influenced access to information digital across
            the world.
          </p>

          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">5. Results and Conclusions</h4>
          <p>
            The results of the research conducted in the article showed,
            overwhelmingly, that there a global disparity in digital information
            access. The global South, which has historically been a place of
            inequality, does not have the same level of access, contribution, or
            representation of digital information that the global North enjoys.
          </p>

          <p>
            These results were predictable, but it is an important step towards
            a more equal level of global information distribution, the more the
            issue is studied, displayed, and understood, the more that can be
            done to find ways to mitigate and resolve the causes of these
            disparities.
          </p>

          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">6. Review of Additional Literature</h4>
          <p>
            What this article describes as “disparities of global information
            geographies” I was taught about under a different name, the “digital
            divide”. In High School level Information Technology and in
            Geography, the syllabus included sections explaining the digital
            divide as a concept describing how some people have access to the
            internet and other digital technologies, and some people, because of
            various factors, do not have this access. What's interesting is that
            this paper focuses on the issue on a global scale, but locally, in a
            South African context, we can see the digital divide right on our
            doorsteps. Just kilometres away from our schools were areas with
            very little access to high-quality digital technology and internet
            access. This is not simply an issue that can be analysed using
            shades of colour on world maps, it is something that should be
            pointed out and seen in our own country and communities. This first
            paragraph has just been talking about my own personal experience,
            not a literature review, so I don't have a source for it, but I do
            believe that my own view on the subject is important as well.
          </p>

          <p>
            The term “Information Geographies” as used in the article is not
            used very commonly among scholars it seems, according to a quick
            search through Google Scholar, but I did find a couple of useful
            articles to review about the geographical nature of the digital
            divide. I read an article written by Mark Graham, who was also an
            author in the article that was just summarized, called “Warped
            Geographies of Development: The Internet and Theories of Economic
            Development”[2], which talks about many of the same subjects as in
            the paper first reviewed, however, the information is not as well
            displayed as it is in the diagrams and maps as in the first article
            I summarized. This article does do a good job of introducing the
            ideas, allowing them to be explored further.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another article that discusses a similar idea: “Segueways into
            Cyberspace: multiple geographies of the digital divide” by Barney
            Warf [3]. It starts by stating the fact that we need to remove the
            idea that the internet and its accessibility removes “geography” as
            a whole and makes us one global community with equal internet
            access. The article talks about the global elite controlling the
            power dynamics of access to technology, how all the factors of
            class, race, gender, religion and most importantly, spatial
            disparities (i.e Information Geographies), severely impacts the
            accessibility of digital information for much of the world. The
            paper analyses datasets of internet users and internet hosts across
            the world, using world maps to display the data in a useful manner.
            In the original article, Graham et al says that this is not an area
            that is very much discussed, however this article, published before
            the one summarized earlier, was published in 1999, revised in 2000,
            the original manuscript for “Towards a Study of Information
            Geographies” was published in 2015. It is clear that there were
            scholars concerned about the study of this issue before the
            conceiving of the topics in the original paper.
          </p>

          <p>
            In fact, “Segueways into Cyberspace” explores the issue down to the
            more nuanced factors of racial, gender and other inequalities and
            how they affect digital information accessibilities. The
            intersectionality presented in the article is important when
            discussing the digital divide because they can provide a better
            framework for finding solutions to these disparities. However, this
            article focuses on those specific issues in the context in the
            United States, which is an easier task than trying to take on those
            issues in the context of the entire global population.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another article, written in 2010: “Theorizing Digital and Urban
            Inequalities: Critical geographies of 'race', gender and
            technological capital” by Melissa Gilbert [4], addresses similar
            issues in the original article. This article also has a focus on the
            United States, it analyses the disparities and inequalities of
            access to digital technology in economically marginalized urban
            residents. It proposes that this view of the issue will better
            inform future frameworks for internet access for people who suffer
            from the inequalities in urban areas. This article does not
            specifically take on the information geographies concept, as in the
            original article, but it does do a good job of explaining the
            smaller nuances of the issue on a very local scale. It does this by
            examining the real-life experiences and views of people directly
            impacted by the digital divide.
          </p>

          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">7. Analysis of Findings</h4>
          <p>
            I found that despite the claims made in “Towards a Study of
            Information Geographies”, the data analysed in the article had been
            analysed before, and it was a topic interested in by several
            scholars, some with even more nuanced views on the factors revolving
            around Information Geographies.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, in saying this, some of the methods used were unique, such
            as analysing data around information access, contribution and well
            as representation. Perhaps this was the meaning of the
            “never-before-done” claim made in the original article. “Towards a
            Study of Information Geographies” does also state that the data and
            findings were extremely limited by the scale at which their data
            collection was done. Things like estimates, more local issues of
            intersectionality of internet access and non-access, and other
            factors out of their control that would impact the data might have
            skewed the actual picture of digital access on a global scale. The
            findings did display a generalized idea of what the digital divide
            and information geographies look like, but it was not specific
            enough to recommend specific frameworks for solutions because of the
            generalized nature of the research done.
          </p>

          <p>
            Something that all the articles reviewed can agree on is that the
            idea that the advent of the era of the internet and digital access
            provides an avenue of infinite internet access for all, is vastly
            overstated and extremely wrong for much of the global population.
            The internet, thus far, is not a global community, is a community of
            those with power, those with liveable income, those with privilege
            and those with the advantage of certain geographical circumstances.
            It is important to understand the geography of this issue, but it is
            also important, as seen in the other articles reviewed, to look
            deeper into local communities and real people to understand the
            reasons and circumstances behind this disparity.
          </p>

          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">8. Avenues for Future Research</h4>
          <p>
            When further research is conducted on this topic, local analyses are
            vital. There is enough information out there about disparities of
            global digital information geographies, there needs to be data
            collected from local communities in all countries, in all areas of
            those countries and frameworks need to be suggested and developed to
            fix these disparities. The scale of this level of data collection
            would be huge, and would take a very long time, but it would be
            worth it to have a database of the specific factors causing the
            digital divide and the lack of digital access across these
            information geographies.
          </p>

          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">9. Conclusion</h4>
          <p>
            From the close reading and analysis of other articles, here is what
            I can conclude: as engineers, web developers, creators of software,
            we bear in mind these disparities, and actively think of them as we
            do work in the digital world. In this era, access to digital access
            should be a basic human right, and the barriers to it should be
            removed and replaced with avenues of accessibility. As those who
            work with software, website design and other digital media, this is
            our space and community, and it should be something we work to
            combat in the way we design and in the way we provide access.
          </p>
          <p>
            We should not only be studying towards information geographies and
            (im)mutable augmentations, but actively finding ways to improve, or
            even break down, the systems in place preventing digital access on a
            global scale.
