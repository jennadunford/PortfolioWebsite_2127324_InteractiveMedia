          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Introduction</h4>
          <p>
            This blog post will serve as a critical reflection on the
            development of this website. I intend to discuss some of the design
            choices I made, such as design of the UX and UI, the use of
            Javascript, I will also be referring to the previous website and how
            I feel I have improved since the submission of that assignment.
          </p>
          <p>
            This post will be separated into the specific design and technical
            components of the development of this website, where I will discuss
            what was implemented, why it was implemented and whether or not I
            feel it was succesful.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">The User Experience</h4>
          <p>
            I go into quite a bit of detail about both the user experience and
            user interface within the style guide (located on the design page of
            this website), and so the discussion here will be a more watered
            down version of the discussion I did in that section, however I do
            recommend referring to the design document for a much deeper
            reflection on the user experience and design development of this
            website.
          </p>
          <p>
            In essence, I decided to implement a user experience that was
            professional, but also welcoming and simple to the user. I also
            wanted the user to experience a representation of myself and my work
            in this website.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to achieve this, I used a minimalist design aesthetic, with
            a small colour palette to make sure that the website was kept simple
            and not overwhelming. I wanted to ensure that there were no
            unnecessary elements. I also did not want to potentionally distract
            the user from important aspects of the website, such as key
            information about myself and my art portfolio.
          </p>
          <p>
            In terms of being welcoming, I tried to keep the tones of the
            written content on the website professional but still
            conversational. I also tried not to put too much written content so
            as not to bore or overwhelm the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            To further achieve the aim of the experience to be introducing a
            representation of myself, the image on the home page are sketches of
            my own hands in different poses, while this is not explicit to the
            user, it is a subtle reference to the face that this website is
            dedicated to artworks and other creations that I used my hands to
            create.
          </p>
          <p>
            To reflect on what I have just written, I do think that I achieved
            what I set out to for the user experience. I feel like there is
            definitely more to be explored, there is always more to explore in
            design, but in terms of what I set out to do for this iteration I am
            happy with my work. I think I did a better job of designing a user
            experience for this site compared to the previous website, I feel
            like the user experience took a back seat while I was designing the
            previous website and I was more focused on creating a site that I
            felt looked good instead of considering the user in the design,
            which was a definite shortfall.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">The User Interface</h4>
          <p>
            For the user interface, there are three main user interfaces to
            discuss. The navigation interface of the website, the blog list
            navigation and the art portfolio interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the website navigation interface, I decided to use a table of
            buttons to allow the user to easily see the navigation buttons. In
            my previous website, I used a fixed, horizontal bar at the top of
            the webpage. My first issue that I saw in retrospect with the
            previous design, is that there was quite a bit of distance between
            the first navigation button and the last because they were so spread
            out across the screen. When working on a laptop screen this could be
            a bit tedious, and so I put the navigation bars in a 2x3 table and
            place it in the center of the webpage to allow easy navigation. The
            new navigation bar on this website is not fixed as well, to allow
            the user to focus on the rest of the content without being
            distracted by the constant presence of the navigation bar.
          </p>
          <p>
            To reflect on the website navigation interface, I feel like I
            improved on the design implemented on the previous website and I
            feel I have considered the user much more in this design. I think
            that my overall user consideration has improved in terms of my
            design methods at this stage.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the blog list user interface, I laid out the blogs in a list
            with a button for the user to navigate to the blog at the end of
            each listing on the blog posts page. I believe that this is
            effective because it allows the user to see all of the blogs
            available, view the titles and descriptions and choose which blog to
            read. There is also a return to blog posts button at the end of each
            page, which allows the user to navigate back to the blog posts page
            to continue reading if they would like to. This interface has not
            changed much from the previous site, I do feel that I iterated on
            this by adding descriptions to the blog posts to allow the user to
            preview each post before navigating to it. To reflect on the
            implementation of this interface, I feel as though it is effective
            and I am happy with the improvements I made with it over its
            development.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the art portfolio user interface, users can use previous and
            next buttons to navigate through the art book, I also make a table
            of contents for the art book that allows users to navigate to
            specific sections of the virtual book. I did this because I wanted
            to give the user the ability to go to sections where perhaps the
            name of the section interested them and they would not have to flip
            through the entire virtual book to access it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I like the art book that I created on the site, and I think that the
            user navigation is good, in reflection I did also like the grid
            gallery I used in the previous website, although there was no user
            interface incoporated into that design. Perhaps a merging of these
            two styles of art portfolio would be effective in the future
            iterations of this website.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Site Navigation</h4>
          <p>
            As per the requirements for this website, the navigation throughout
            the pages of the site are handled by javascript. I use jquerys in a
            specialised nav.js script in order to navigate through the pages,
            accessing page elements from their id's to trigger the navigation
            code. With this method, the javascript file is totally separate from
            the html and there are no javascript related commands within the
            html. The resulting navigation was effective and smooth and worked
            well both on Live Server and Github after a bit of testing and
            debugging.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Accessibility</h4>
          <p>
            For accessibility on my website, I made sure that all images had alt
            text included with them, I made all the text black on a white
            background to provide accessibility for users who may experience
            forms of colourblindness. I also made sure that all html content
            existed within appropriate containers with semantic mark-up to
            ensure easy access for users who may need to utilize screen readers
            that rely on these conventions.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Aesthetics</h4>
          <p>
            Why chose minimalism why chose book for portfolio why do colours
            like i did
          </p>

          <p>basic talking about technical development stuff</p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Semantic Markup</h4>
          <p>

          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Metadata</h4>
          <p>what meta data things did i do, why do them, effective y or no</p>

            What headers and microformatting did i do. why. did i do them good ?
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">External CSS and JS Linking</h4>
          <p>
            just say that i did not do a good job of linking last time but i
            understand css better now and linked things externally this time
          </p>
