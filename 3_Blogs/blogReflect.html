          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Introduction</h4>
          <p>
            This blog post will serve as a critical reflection on the
            development of this website. I intend to discuss some of the design
            choices I made, such as design of the UX and UI, the use of
            Javascript, I will also be referring to the previous website and how
            I feel I have improved since the submission of that assignment.
          </p>
          <p>
            This post will be separated into the specific design and technical
            components of the development of this website, where I will discuss
            what was implemented, why it was implemented and whether or not I
            feel it was succesful.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">The User Experience</h4>
          <p>
            I go into quite a bit of detail about both the user experience and
            user interface within the style guide (located on the design page of
            this website), and so the discussion here will be a more watered
            down version of the discussion I did in that section, however I do
            recommend referring to the design document for a much deeper
            reflection on the user experience and design development of this
            website.
          </p>
          <p>
            In essence, I decided to implement a user experience that was
            professional, but also welcoming and simple to the user. I also
            wanted the user to experience a representation of myself and my work
            in this website.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to achieve this, I used a minimalist design aesthetic, with
            a small colour palette to make sure that the website was kept simple
            and not overwhelming. I wanted to ensure that there were no
            unnecessary elements. I also did not want to potentionally distract
            the user from important aspects of the website, such as key
            information about myself and my art portfolio.
          </p>
          <p>
            In terms of being welcoming, I tried to keep the tones of the
            written content on the website professional but still
            conversational. I also tried not to put too much written content so
            as not to bore or overwhelm the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            To further achieve the aim of the experience to be introducing a
            representation of myself, the image on the home page are sketches of
            my own hands in different poses, while this is not explicit to the
            user, it is a subtle reference to the face that this website is
            dedicated to artworks and other creations that I used my hands to
            create.
          </p>
          <p>
            To reflect on what I have just written, I do think that I achieved
            what I set out to for the user experience. I feel like there is
            definitely more to be explored, there is always more to explore in
            design, but in terms of what I set out to do for this iteration I am
            happy with my work. I think I did a better job of designing a user
            experience for this site compared to the previous website, I feel
            like the user experience took a back seat while I was designing the
            previous website and I was more focused on creating a site that I
            felt looked good instead of considering the user in the design,
            which was a definite shortfall.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">The User Interface</h4>
          <p>
            For the user interface, there are three main user interfaces to
            discuss. The navigation interface of the website, the blog list
            navigation and the art portfolio interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the website navigation interface, I decided to use a table of
            buttons to allow the user to easily see the navigation buttons. In
            my previous website, I used a fixed, horizontal bar at the top of
            the webpage. My first issue that I saw in retrospect with the
            previous design, is that there was quite a bit of distance between
            the first navigation button and the last because they were so spread
            out across the screen. When working on a laptop screen this could be
            a bit tedious, and so I put the navigation bars in a 2x3 table and
            place it in the center of the webpage to allow easy navigation. The
            new navigation bar on this website is not fixed as well, to allow
            the user to focus on the rest of the content without being
            distracted by the constant presence of the navigation bar.
          </p>
          <p>
            To reflect on the website navigation interface, I feel like I
            improved on the design implemented on the previous website and I
            feel I have considered the user much more in this design. I think
            that my overall user consideration has improved in terms of my
            design methods at this stage.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the blog list user interface, I laid out the blogs in a list
            with a button for the user to navigate to the blog at the end of
            each listing on the blog posts page. I believe that this is
            effective because it allows the user to see all of the blogs
            available, view the titles and descriptions and choose which blog to
            read. There is also a return to blog posts button at the end of each
            page, which allows the user to navigate back to the blog posts page
            to continue reading if they would like to. This interface has not
            changed much from the previous site, I do feel that I iterated on
            this by adding descriptions to the blog posts to allow the user to
            preview each post before navigating to it. To reflect on the
            implementation of this interface, I feel as though it is effective
            and I am happy with the improvements I made with it over its
            development.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the art portfolio user interface, users can use previous and
            next buttons to navigate through the art book, I also make a table
            of contents for the art book that allows users to navigate to
            specific sections of the virtual book. I did this because I wanted
            to give the user the ability to go to sections where perhaps the
            name of the section interested them and they would not have to flip
            through the entire virtual book to access it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I like the art book that I created on the site, and I think that the
            user navigation is good, in reflection I did also like the grid
            gallery I used in the previous website, although there was no user
            interface incoporated into that design. Perhaps a merging of these
            two styles of art portfolio would be effective in the future
            iterations of this website.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Site Navigation</h4>
          <p>
            As per the requirements for this website, the navigation throughout
            the pages of the site are handled by javascript. I use jquerys in a
            specialised nav.js script in order to navigate through the pages,
            accessing page elements from their id's to trigger the navigation
            code. With this method, the javascript file is totally separate from
            the html and there are no javascript related commands within the
            html. The resulting navigation was effective and smooth and worked
            well both on Live Server and Github after a bit of testing and
            debugging.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Accessibility</h4>
          <p>
            For accessibility on my website, I made sure that all images had alt
            text included with them, I made all the text black on a white
            background to provide accessibility for users who may experience
            forms of colourblindness. I also made sure that all html content
            existed within appropriate containers with semantic mark-up to
            ensure easy access for users who may need to utilize screen readers
            that rely on these conventions.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Aesthetics</h4>
          <p>
            I chose minimalism because I did not want to go overboard with
            adding a whole bunch of flashy elements to the site without meaning,
            minimalism, as in the name, means taking a minimal approach to
            design and only including elements that serve a specific purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            I incorporated minimalism into my design aesthetic by only using a
            small colour palette of similar shades of colour, not having much
            content on each page, choosing a simple font, and overall just
            trying to keep the content on each page as minimal as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also aimed for minimalism in my previous site, but I think that I
            did a better job of communicating it with this website. Reflecting
            at the design of my previous design, I did not take a good
            minimalist approach, some of the pages had too much content and
            elements on it. Some of the pages seemed too crowded, it would take
            long to load, and it did not communicate the minimalism that I
            wanted.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think I took a better approach with the aesthetic for this site,
            and I do find it overall more aesthetically pleasing.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Technical Reflections</h4>
          <p>
            Talking generally about the technical development of this website, I
            started completely from scratch. I did not use the same files as
            from the original site, I built everything up again. I chose to do
            this because I did not feel I handled the development very well in
            the previous site, my html was sloppy without the proper semantic
            markup, I had included css within the html and did not utilize
            external linking very well, and so I wanted to start from the
            beginning and make sure I did everything right instead of going back
            and looking for issues to fix.
          </p>
          <p>
            I feel like technically this was a good approach for me, it was
            better to start from a clean slate because I had a better idea of
            how to approach the development of this site.
          </p>
          <p>
            I struggled a bit with trying to get the javascript to work both in
            liveserver and github, but I did manage to troubleshoot everything
            and get it working eventally.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Semantic Markup</h4>
          <p>
            In terms of the semantic mark-up of the html, I practiced the
            following:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Making sure all lists were either in ordered or unordered list
              tags, depending on the purpose of the content.
            </li>
            <li>
              Making sure all titles and sub headings were kept in H tags, which
              increased in order of importance of the H tag, for example the
              main title of the website is always an h1 tag, and these decrease
              as more titles are added.
            </li>
            <li>
              Making sure all large sections of text were in article tags.
            </li>
            <li>
              Making sure paragraphs and small sections of text were in p tags
            </li>
            <li>
              Using section tags to separate different sections of content when
              needed
            </li>
            <li>
              Making sure all images had alt text with them in case the image is
              unable to load
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Metadata</h4>
          <p>
            For the metadata in the html files, I ensured that I included
            keywords for each page of the website, as well as a description and
            the author (me).
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Headers and Microformatting</h4>
          <p>
            I used microformatting for each page where the title of the site is
            used, declaring it an h-card. I used feeds and entries to describe
            the list of blog posts and then the blog posts themselves.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">External CSS and JS Linking</h4>
          <p>
            All css and javascript files were linked externally. There is no
            reference to css or javascript within the actual html code. I
            understand that this is good practice because it allows you to keep
            everything separate from one another, and so you can edit the css
            and javascript without directly interfering with the html.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Optimization of Media</h4>
          <p>
            On the previous website, my art image file sizes were extremely
            large, with slowed down the site where I had images of my art. For
            this website, I used a program called PNGoo to decrease the file
            sizes of png images, which would take the longest to load.
          </p>
          <p>
            For further optimization during the development of this website -
            images that exceeded 10MB in size were compressed to increase the
            speed and optimization of this website.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Responsiveness</h4>
          <p>
            On the initial version of this website, I did not take into account
            responsiveness, for later versions, I paid close attention to how
            the website would look on different screen sizes and account for
            this in the css using media queries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using the inspect tool and the responsive resizing feature, I
            checked every possible dimension for the webpage, and included media
            queries within the CSS for when issues occured for each page, this
            should ensure that the website is responsive and usable for every
            form factor on which it is displayed.
          </p>

          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">
            Reflections on the Development of this Website: from Assignment 1 to
            Now
          </h4>
          <p>
            To reflect on the development of my portfolio website from
            assignment 1 to the submission of this website, I think that I
            improved a lot in the way I design and in the way I approach the
            technical side of the website.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have had to do research and a learn a lot about javascript
            practices and css, I have been able to experiment with css and
            javascript in various ways. I have improved in the web development
            and design skills, I also now have a lot of ideas on how to iterate
            this website further into a better, final version.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">
            Reflections on the Development of this Website: from Assignment 2 to
            Now
          </h4>
          <p>
            This final version of the website should represent a definitive,
            well-researched, well-designed, and professional final product. It
            should also showcase my skills as a web developer and design that I
            have gained throughout the development of this website.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that all things can be made better with time and effort,
            even in the most polished state, something can always be added or
            removed to better the experience of a product. This is especially
            true for times like now where technology and the expections of
            technology are always changing and evolving. For this final version
            of the website, iterated from the website submitted for assignment
            2, I put a lot of thought and effort into the changes that needed to
            be made - especially taking into account the feedback given for
            assignment 2 - and I do believe that I have done an exceptional job
            in creating a robust final version for this submission.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, I do not believe it is perfect, but I do believe that
            this website showcases my skills and improvement as a web designer
            and developer, I believe that I have defended all of the decisions
            that I have made well. I also believe that this website is
            indicitive of a well thought out design philosophy of minimalism,
            and that the external JavaScript library dependencies have been used
            well.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a portfolio, I believe that this website represents myself and my
            work wonderfully. As the goal of this assignment was to create a

            Reflecting on Myself as a Designer and Developer in Interactive
            Media Over this Semester
          </h4>
          <p>
            Interactive media. The creation, discussion, and exploration of all
            things media and all things interactive. Internet technologies are
            at the heart of all of this - as it can be the very definition of
            media that is, at its core, interactive (depending on your own
            definition of interactive, that is).
          </p>
          <p>
            This course has allowed me to deeply and critically explore who I am
            as a designer and developer of interactive content. I have been able
            to write long critical writing pieces on internet technologies and
            about my own work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Importantly, this course introduced discussions around the impact of
            the designers of interactive media, and how our own designs and
            programs can be used to change the world, for better or for worse.
          </p>
          <p>
            In reflection - the final reflection - I do think that I have
            changed. I have of course learnt how to better use JavaScript, HTML,
            and CSS, I have learnt about the design principles of websites, but
            I have also learnt about who I want to be as a developer of
            interactive media. I want to be a developer and designer that uses
            the vast tools of the internet to try and make the world a better
            place for everyone, whether it is in making my designs responsive,
            allowing for accessibility for people of different abilities, or for
            using platforms on the internet to discuss issues and ideas which
            can help to introduce discussions about change in our society.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would not be so bold as to say something along the lines of "with
            the information from this course I have now have the tools to change
            the world" - no. But I do think that I have been given the
            opportunity to think about the things that I make and the impact
            that they can have - however small and insignificant - I have been
            empowered with a small awareness of myself and my creations. With
            this, I end my overall reflection.
