            <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Why External JavaScript Libraries?</h4>
            <p>
              I have chosen two external JavaScript libraries that add to the
              creativity and overall experience of this website. I decided to
              use the external libraries to enhance the about section of this
              website and the art portfolio section.
            </p>
            <p>
              The JavaScript libraries chosen were turn.js and slick.js. Both of
              these libraries will be discussed including:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Their Functionality</li>
              <li>Their Alternatives</li>
              <li>Impact on User Experience</li>
              <li>Impact on Creative and Technical Site Aspects</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 class="blogSubtitle">turn.js</h4>
            <p>
              Turn.js is a JavaScript library which allows you to create a
              realistic page-turning effect using HTML5. The library is easy to
              download and use, with understandable and comprehensive
              documentation. The library also makes use of JQuery, which makes
              integrating it into the existing site JavaScript quite simple and
              easy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Two other alternatives were investigated while looking for page
              turning libraries to implement on this website:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>page-flip</li>
              <li>flip.js</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              While researching the alternatives, it was seen that turn.js had
              the simplest documentation and also provided the best experience
              when testing out the demos for the libraries, and so, turn.js was
              chosen instead of the other two alternatives.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the user experience, this library was chosen in order to
              create a metaphor user experience design for the art portfolio.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using this library, I was able to create a virtual artbook to
              display my artworks, complete with a unique page-turning effect.
              The metaphor design concept was used to enhance the user
              experience and to communicate the purpose of the portfolio page -
              that the artworks should be flipped through as if they were in a
              physical book.
            </p>
            <p>
              Technically and creatively, the usage of this library greatly
              elevated the design and complexity of the site. The creativity was
              was enhanced by being able to incorporate a metaphor design
              principle in the website, and technically, the usage of the
              external library was simple and easy to manage - allowing for a
              well-structured script to handle the library's functionality.
            </p>
            <h4 class="blogSubtitle">slick.js</h4>
            <p>
              Slick.js is a JavaScript library that allows various carousel
              functionalities for webpages. The library includes a number of
              features for responsiveness on various devices, and the final
              result is very smooth and professional.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are many other carousel JavaScript libraries, but after
              reading through several lists of them, slick.js looks to be the
              best for performance, simplicity of functions, and responsiveness.
            </p>
            <p>
              Slick.js was used on this website to enhance the about page by
              including a changing title effect, and creating carousels for
              showing technical projects and inspirations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Slick.js provided professional looking features that enhanced the
              user experience of the website by making the design page visually
              interesting (with the addition of the fading and changing title
              effect) and also creating small sections where users could swipe
              or click through slides containing information about my technical
              skills and my various inspirations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because the code functionalities of the slick.js library are
              simple and easy to understand and use, the script that handles the
              carousel effect is well-structured and functions perfectly.
            </p>
            <h4 class="blogSubtitle">In Conclusion</h4>
            <p>
              Two external JavaScript libraries were utilized for this website,
              enhancing the creative and technical aspects of the about and
              portfolio pages, as well as adding to the overall user experience.
