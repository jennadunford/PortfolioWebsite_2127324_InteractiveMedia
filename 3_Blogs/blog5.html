          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">UX Decisions and Discussions</h4>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">What is UX?</h4>
          <p>
            UX stands for "User Experience", and so it is how the experience, or
            the journey of the user, is designed on a platform, in this case, a
            website. From the name, UX design is very focused on the user, and
            so every aspect of it is linked back to the experience of the user.
            Decisions are made with the user in mind and how the designer wants
            the user to experience their platform.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">
            How Did I Use UX to Inform Design Decisions?
          </h4>
          <p>
            In general, the focus of the design of my website was ease. I wanted
            everything to be easily labeled and easy to understand. The
            navigation bar takes up a large portion of the web page and is
            always visible while scrolling through pages to allow the user to be
            able to navigate through the website easily. There are many
            different ways to get to different pages, other than on the
            navigation bar, I put back buttons wherever I thought it made sense:
            at the end of an individual blog there was a button allowing the
            user to return to the list of blogs. On the home page, there are 2
            ways to access the art page and the blogs page, through the
            navigation bar and through other hyperlinks. I made the text quite
            large in order to be readable for the user. I tried to stick to a
            small color palette and tried for my web pages to be minimalistic
            without too many elements.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Did I Design the UX Effectively, or Not?</h4>
          <p>
            I do think that my attempt was good, however, I feel like I let the
            "ease" factor I was so focused on make the website as a whole a bit
            boring. I wish I had been a bit more experimental with my design
            choices and had more fun with the user experience. I think that the
            choice to make the navigation bar large and always in focus made
            some parts of the website a bit clunky, and I think that I did not
            achieve the minimalist aesthetic I wanted because of that initial
            decision. A lot more thought needs to go into my user experience
            decisions and I need to find other methods of creating a good user
            experience without just focusing on making it "easy".

            Reflection on my own UX Design in Light of UX Literature
          </h4>
          <p>
            Hassenzahl and Tractinsky in their paper "User Experience - a
            research agenda" discuss the three facets of UX design: Beyond the
            instrumental, emotion and affect, and experiential. I think that
            while I paid much attention to the experiential, making sure the
            experience was "easy" - I made my UX very one-dimensional.
            Therefore, in reflection, I believe that I can improve my user
            experience design on my website by considering the "beyond the
            instrumental" and the "emotion and affect" areas more when it comes
            to re-designing parts of my website.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">UI Decisions and Discussions</h4>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">What is UI?</h4>
          <p>
            User Interface design refers to the design of the graphical
            interfaces in software that users interact with. This can be
            anything from the style of the interfaces to the different looks and
            aesthetic decisions made. User Interface design is also linked with
            User Experience, the UX should inform the UI.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">
            How Did I Use UI to Inform Design Decisions?
          </h4>
          <p>
            As I mentioned in my UX section, I wanted a minimalist aesthetic on
            my website with not much going on, and so when it came to the user
            interface I only put elements that I thought would be absolutely
            necessary. I also used a very limited color palette, because I did
            not want the user to become distracted or annoyed with lots of
            different colors on the website. I used traditional elements of UI
            design, having a vertical navigation bar at the top of the page,
            which was also fixed. I made the background of the website white and
            most of the text black, as this is the best for readability.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Did I Design the UI Effectively, or Not?</h4>
          <p>
            One glaring shortcoming is that I had a lot of focus on the graphic
            user interface design - but not so much a semantic design, for users
            who do not use graphic interfaces who would only use screen readers
            to experience a website. I did neglect the semantic markup of my
            site for much of the design as I was mainly focusing on all of the
            other parts of the website. And so I do not think my UI was very
            effective in terms of design. I need to look at the different
            aspects of UI design, and as before I need to try not to limit
            myself by something I want to achieve in the UI, I should allow my
            UI design to be flexible to allow for experimentation.
          </p>

          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">
            Reflection on my own UI Design in Light of UI Literature
          </h4>
          <p>
            In Marcus's paper, Metaphor Design for User Interfaces, Marcus
            describes how sometimes using metaphors from real-life objects can
            help users become experts at using your own user interface, such as
            computers using metaphors such as "files", "recycling bin",
            "notepad" to help users understand the purposes of the functions of
            their interface. Because my website is a portfolio, perhaps it would
            be helpful to use metaphors from an art portfolio to help users
            learn how to navigate the interface from a real-life example. I did
            not implement this in my website, showing how little I actually
            thought about the user interface, but in reflection this paper
            should help inform further iterations of my website's UI design.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Reflections</h4>
          <p>
            This first assignment was a very useful exercise in determining the
            shortcomings of both my UX and UI design, and reviewing the
            literature on UX and UI design in light of my initial decisions was
            also very helpful. Outside of website design, this is also very
            useful when thinking about user interfaces and experience design in
            things like video games and other pieces of software. There is no
            doubt in my mind that my UX and UI will change a lot in the next
            iterations of my website, and this time with special considerations
            taken towards the literature reflections in this critical writing
            piece.
