          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Introduction</h4>
          <p>
            URLs are a fundamental part of how we experience the internet today.
            This piece of writing will guide the reader through the following
            questions: what is an URL, why do we need URLs, who invented URLs,
            and how do they work. Hopefully, this will give the reader some
            insight into the wonderful creation that is the URL, how they work,
            and its history.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">1. What is a URL?</h4>
          <p>
            URL stands for Universal Resource Locator<a href="#ref1">[1]</a
            ><a href="#ref6">[6]</a><a href="#ref8">[8]</a>. Universal, meaning
            this thing can be used by anyone, anywhere. Resource, meaning a set
            of some kind of information existing on the internet. Locator,
            meaning finding where a resource is sitting <a href="#ref1">[1]</a
            ><a href="#ref2">[2]</a>.Something that can be used by anyone,
            anywhere to find where a piece of information is sitting on the
            world wide web. In essence, URLs are strings that are used to take
            users to specific sets of information on the web<a href="#ref1"
              >[1]</a
            ><a href="#ref2">[2]</a>. The characters of the strings that make up
            URLs can consist of all the letters of the alphabet, plus signs,
            periods, and hyphens <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>. URLs should be
            interpreted with uppercase and lowercase characters meaning the same
            thing<a href="#ref1">[1]</a>. There are some characters that should
            not be used lightly when making up these strings because they could
            have a special meaning to the URL, these include digits, percentage
            signs, "<" and ">" and others<a href="#ref1">[1]</a>. URLs use
            protocols to know what kind of information is being accessed by a
            particular string<a href="#ref1">[1]</a>. For example, HTTP stands
            for HyperText Transfer Protocol - allowing text and other
            information to be displayed on a web page that can be accessed
            through a URL<a href="#ref1">[1]</a>. FTP stands for File Transfer
            Protocol, which allows a URL to send a user to files or directories
            stored on the internet. Something important to note is accessibility
            - just because a user has a URL that leads to a web page - does not
            mean that that user can access it <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>.
            Sometimes, web pages and other information on the internet are
            restricted so that only certain users can access them. An URL can
            definitely allow you to locate where a bit of information exists on
            the internet, but having that URL does not automatically grant you
            access to that information. I could share the URL of the private
            settings section on one of my social media accounts with somebody,
            but just because that person now has the URL to my private settings
            does not mean that they can access it, it will be locked by a
            password. Some URLs can only be accessed if a user is on a specific
            network, and so on and so forth.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">2. Why do we Need URLs?</h4>
          <p>
            Imagine a bit of information on the internet is a needle, and you
            have to search for this needle of information in a haystack - but
            the haystack is actually made of billions of other needles, and you
            need to sift through all of them to find the specific needle that
            you need. A URL acts as a clever bit of string that can find and
            pull your specific needle to you - no need to go painfully digging
            through every needle in the stack. (See, I did a clever pun with the
            word string because URLs are strings and you can also pull literal
            pieces of strings through needles.) Before the advent of URLs, if
            you needed information on the internet - the only way to access this
            information would be to directly connect to wherever that
            information is stored, directly dial your device's connection to the
            specific place on the internet you wanted to be, similar to dialing
            a number on a telephone<a href="#ref4">[4]</a>. Connections could
            only be established if both devices were online and ready to be
            established, in the 1970s it would be impossible to send an email to
            someone if that someone's computer was not online while the email
            was being sent<a href="#ref4">[4]</a>. Thanks to URLs and the
            advancement of internet technologies, we can skip over needing to
            directly connect to where information is being stored to display it,
            and rather just locate and access it through a URL.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">3. Who Came up with URLs?</h4>
          <p>
            Tim Berners-Lee invented the URL in 1992<a href="#ref4">[4]</a>. In
            1994, Berners-Lee released a memo detailing the usage of URLs and
            how they work<a href="#ref1">[1]</a>. It is available on the
            Internet Engineering Taskforce's website<a href="#ref1">[1]</a>. The
            Internet Engineering Taskforce(IETF), founded in 1986, is an
            organization that promotes the open development of the internet,
            there is no formal membership of this task force, it basically
            manages the general standards of the internet that we use, including
            things like the internet protocols that exist within URLs<a
              href="#ref7"
              >[7]</a
            >. The IETF has a heavy stance on the openness of information, where
            all of their documentation, all of their resources are very
            open-source and available to anyone or any organization who would
            like to access them<a href="#ref5">[5]</a>.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">4. How do they Work?</h4>
          <p>
            We have some information that exists on a network, which is great.
            Now how do we allow others to access this information? How do we
            allow others to access this information freely and without
            restriction? Here is the problem <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>. The
            solution that we have is an "object" of sorts that points to where
            that information exists. How does this solution work exactly? A URL
            consists of 5 parts that allow a web browser and an internet
            connection to figure out where exactly your information is sitting<a
              href="#ref3"
              >[3]</a
            >. The first part of the URL is the protocol that it needs to use
            when accessing the web page, the most common one for us is HTTP, it
            tells the URL how that information is being stored, for HTTP it
            means it is a hypertext mark up protocol, which displays websites<a
              href="#ref3"
              >[3]</a
            >. The second part of the URL is the subdomain, this is the specific
            page on a webpage where the information exists<a href="#ref3">[3]</a
            >. The third part of the URL is the Second Level Doman (SLD) - this
            is the name of the website usually<a href="#ref3">[3]</a>. The
            fourth part is Top Level Domain - it is an identifier to show what
            kind of organization is running a website, such as .com, .org,
            .co.za, .gov these all describe to the user and the URL who is
            displaying this information<a href="#ref3">[3]</a>. The fifth part
            is the subdirectory - this shows the user which specific part of the
            website the user is on<a href="#ref3">[3]</a>. A web browser takes
            all these parts of the URL and finds where exactly a piece of
            information is sitting and directs the user to that information. And
            now we know how URLs work<a href="#ref3">[3]</a>.
          </p>
          <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Conclusion</h4>
          <p>
            Thank you for reading this. We've learned some interesting
            information about how we as users can locate and access information
            on the internet using URLs, as well as a small part of the history
            behind them. Thanks again!
