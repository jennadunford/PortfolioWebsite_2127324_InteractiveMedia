            <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Defining The Internet</h4>
            <p>
              The world that we live in is no longer a purely physical space.
              All around us, basic human interactions are migrating to digital
              spheres. The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic has caused this
              "digital migration" to rapidly grow, we witnessed the world change
              before our very eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Integral parts of society started to exist more and more online.
              As we cautiously take steps towards leaving our pandemic-stricken
              state of living - a lot of these online digital spaces will
              remain. New norms have formed. You could say that the world has
              changed, but it is more nuanced than that. The digital world has
              grown, it has tightened its grip on our lives, and the physical
              world has been beaten down by the pandemic and the following
              economic crisis. Those who were unable to fully migrate into these
              new online spaces were left in the dust of progress.
            </p>
            <p>
              We cannot define the concept of the internet now the same way we
              would have pre-2020. It is no longer simply a place to connect, to
              find and transmit information. The internet is so much more now.
              The internet is an important organ of the modern humans societal
              "body". With the internet, people join educational platforms,
              people find jobs, people work their jobs, businesses operate,
              commerce exists, and people access resources for health. A person
              left now without access to the digital world is left in darkness.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this brave new digital world, the internet is a basic human
              right - alongside shelter, water, and health. Without it, how do
              we expect someone to fully participate and pursue happiness in our
              society.
            </p>
            <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Defining Society</h4>
            <p>
              We can define society by the rules, conventions, and systems that
              form the structure of our daily lives. The digital world itself is
              a system that forms part of people's lives now, and so it makes up
              our society today.
            </p>
            <p>
              The implication that the digital space is a part of modern society
              means that, due to the unequal access to technology and internet,
              there is active exclusion of marginalized individuals and groups
              from modern society. Exclusion from society is a dangerous
              situation for any individual. Resources, information, education,
              healthcare, the job market all exist in some shape or form online.
              To individuals who have always had access to the internet, it
              seemed necessary to begin to move so many of these things online,
              and it is clear not much thought was given to the people who would
              be left behind.
            </p>
            <p>
              A large part of our society exists in the digital space. This is
              undeniable. And so it is also undeniable that this digital
              migration to online spaces has left some people unable to fully
              and meaningfully participate in society. This concept sounds like
              the plot of a dystopian sci-fi story, but it is now a reality.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is not only the internet that makes up part of our society, it
              is also the technologies that come with it. Algorithms that read
              in human behavior and then classify individuals make up a
              structure in modern society as well. Algorithms, lines of code,
              have the power to label and identify people by their gender, the
              color of their skin. Algorithms can determine which people are
              shown job listings in various fields, they can also determine
              whether or not to label individuals as dangerous based on the
              inherent discriminatory practices in our society.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although it was thought that the onset of the digital age would
              bring down the barriers that prevent people from accessing
              information and sharing their voices, the technology has only
              brought along new ways to exacerbate already existing prejudices
              and discrimination. Without addressing and destroying the core
              problems at the very root of our modern society, technology has
              simply adapted to them. It could even be argued that some parts of
              technology have made these problems even worse.
            </p>
            <p>
              This new society with the internet and digital spaces embedded
              within it has great power. It has the power to connect people to
              valuable resources, to bring different people and cultures
              together, but there is also a great burden now. There is the
              burden of trying to make sure that this technology is not misused,
              and to ensure that it accessible to all, not only accessible to
              the already privileged.
            </p>
            <h4 class="blogSubtitle">Defining Design Justice</h4>
            <p>
              And now, what is design justice? We need justice for marginalized
              individuals and communities in terms of accessibility to
              technology, as well as preventing discrimination due to
              technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              Technology does not exist in a vacuum, and it is not a thing of
              nature. Technology will always be a product of the people that
              design and develop it. Although there is a perception that
              technology and algorithms are inherently neutral, any biases held
              by the designers and developers will be communicated in the design
              of these technologies. Here lies the problem. There is a broad
              lack of accountability that exists amongst the people making this
              technology. Marginalized groups are also desperately
              underrepresented in the tech community.
            </p>
            <p>
              When it comes to undoing and repairing the damage done by
              oppression, it cannot be the oppressors doing the repairing.
              Solutions to the problems that impact marginalized groups cannot
              be created without those marginalized individuals and communities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Design justice. Designing technology for justice. Designing
              technology that dismantles discrimination, designing technology
              while being extremely mindful of the power that it has, and the
              biases that it could contain.
            </p>
            <p>
              Design justice includes accessibility. There can be no design
              justice for people if those people cannot access the technology in
              the first place. Allof these problems are vastly intersectional in
              nature, all existing together, and they must all be dealt with
              together as well. There cannot be only justice for one group, one
              community, one issue, design justice must be done for all and for
              every existing problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a huge implication, and although small steps towards a
              just digital society are good, it is important for us as designers
              and developers to remember that the work will never truly be
              finished. Not until there is global access to the digital world,
              and access without discrimination embedded within it.
            </p>
            <p>
              And the work of design justice will never truly be done either.
              Society is not a static concept, our world and our mindsets are
              forever changing. We have seen just how fast our daily lives can
              be changed after living through a global pandemic.
            </p>
            <p>
              With this being said, I think that the conclusion can be made that
              design justice is not a goal or a target. Design justice should be
              a mindset, a strategy, a constant and ever-present force driven by
              the people in communities of technology and programming. We do not
              strive for some final goal of design justice, we must strive for
              design justice to be ever-present and evident in our work and our
              designs. And there can be no design justice without the people who
              need the justice deeply involved with it. We need accessibility,
              we need people willing to give voices to marginalized people, and
              we must allow affected communities to take up more spaces within
              the structures that discriminate against them so that those
              structures can be dismantled.
            </p>
            <p>
              Internet, society, and design justice. These are complex issues,
              but they are all human issues, and our way of life is deeply
              dependent now on all of them.
