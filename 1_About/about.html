            My name is Jenna (she/her), I am a 21 year old Engineering and
            Digital Arts student at the University of the Witwatersrand, welcome
            to my About page.
          </p>
          <p>
            What is there to know about me? I enjoy programming, I can code in
            Assembly, C#, C++ and Javascript. I have experience with making
            games in Unity, mainly 2D games.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love to draw, I would love to someday pursue a career as a
            freelance illustrator. I love to explore the styles of various
            animated shows with my art, I love to use pastel and bright colours
            and I love to draw witches.
          </p>
          <p>
            For all of the games I have made throughout my game design course, I
            have made my own art assets and have animated them as well.

        <article>
          <p>
            As part of my engineering degree, I had to progam a microprocesor
            using assembly code, while it was very basic, just programming an
            8-bit LED light to display random numbers, making red and green
            lights flash with button presses, it was still challenging and very
            enjoyable.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have made several games throughout my degree as well, including 2D
            and 3D games, I have experimented with platformers, turn-based
            combat games, physics-based games and exploration games.

            You can exlore my abilites with regards to web design by taking a

                electric alternative.

        <h3 class="aboutSubtitle">My Inspirations</h3>
        <article>
          <p>
            My most important inspirations for my art comes from other artists.
            Akira Toriyama, the artist of Dragon Ball, is one of my favorites. I
            love his environment designs the most, beautiful pre-historic and
            futuristic environments creating these wonderful mystical worlds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another artist I admire is Julia Potts, creator of the cartoon show
            'Summer Camp Island' - I love the whimsical character designs in the
            show, the cute faces that adorn trees, rocks and other environment
            elements. I love the colours of the show and the peace that it
            brings me.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a game designer, I also look to games for inspirations. My
            favorite games include Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing: New
            Horizons, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and Don't Starve.
            I enjoy mainly cosy, peaceful games with beautiful art and gentle
            music. I enjoy Don't Starve for it's creepy Tim-Burton-Esqe art
            direction and for the thrill of the survival element.
          </p>
          <p>
            For insight about my inspirations with regards to my website design,
            please take a look at the Inpirations section of the Design page.

              me.
            </p>
            <p>
              Everything that I have made has deep roots in hundreds of
              thousands of influences from music, to artists, to movies, to
              books, and everything further and in-between.
            </p>

          <article class="inspoText">
            <img class="inspoImage" src="Images/Akira-Toriyama.jpg" />
            <p>
              Akira Toriyama is the artist and writer of the manga and anime
              that became a world-wide cultural phenomenon: Dragon Ball. There
              are few people in the world who have not at least seen a picture
              of the main character, Goku, as it is difficult to escape the vast
              reach of his story.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started to watch Dragon Ball at the beginning of the covid-19
              pandemic - in a time of confusion, fear, and solitude, it was
              difficult to immediately not fall in love with the characters, the
              artwork, the story, and the friendships that Toriyama had crafted.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since discovering the amazing works of Akira Toriyama, I have kept
              them in mind as inspiration and reference for my own artworks and
              creations. I also take with me the messages from his stories -
              about friendship, love, courage, pride, and persevering despite
              every hurdle in the universe.

            <p>
              The internet and social media has been a goldmine of influences
              for art, I am so grateful that through the internet I have been
              able to discover some of the most amazing and wonderful artists
              and works of art.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of my most absolute favorite artists that I discovered online
              was @tsurudraws on twitter. Their use of colour, their skill with
              character design, their linework, their painting, and everything
              else they excel at has deeply inspired and influenced my own art
              in wonderful ways.
            </p>
            <p>
              Their artworks always bring me a deep sense of calm and happiness.
              There is something so gentle and soft in what they create. I
              strive in my own work to try and replicate these feelings, and
              they inspire me every day to improve my craft as I aspire to
              become an artist like them.

            <p>
              Video games are a large part of my life and the things that bring
              me happiness. I love discovering amazing games that bring me
              endless joy and entertainment, especially games with which I can
              curl up under the covers on a rainy day and take in all their calm
              and gentle excitement.
            </p>
            <p>
              Stardew Valley is one such game, and the dedication and love from
              its creator, Concerned Ape, truly comes through in every tiny
              detail and pixel in this charming farm-life simulator game.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is always astonishing to find out that I game was created by
              one person alone - but the vastness of Stardew Valley really makes
              this an amazing feat. With this is the continued work and
              dedication that ConcernedApe continues to put into the game,
              although it came out years ago, it is far from abandoned with new
              updates and content being added, with the creator never stepping
              away from it.
            </p>
            <p>
              If I manage to achieve my dream of someday being a sucessful game
              designer and developer in some capacity, I do hope to be like
              ConcernedApe, and I hope that whatever I made is even a fraction
              as wonderful as his games.

              Animation is such a delightful medium. For animation to be
              effective, every frame needs to essentially be a work of art,
              every character's movements are meticulously thought out and
              choreographed by teams of extremely talented animators and
              artists. Even a minute of animation can equate to hundreds of
              hours of planning, drawing, and working.
            </p>
            <p>
              All this makes animation itself a truly wonderful thing to
              experience, and one of my favorite animated shows is Summer Camp
              Island, created by Julia Potts.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I first saw this show, I thought that it must have been made
              for me. The colours, the characters, the music, the humour -
              everything about it made me so happy and delighted. Summer Camp
              Island is such a wonderful show with especially wonderful art.

              I love to spend time studying screenshots of the landscapes and
              foliage, learning about colour, composition, and design by trying
              to replicate the unique beauty of this show. Summer Camp Island
              inspires me to improve my art, and it is also a wonderful escape
              into a gentle and welcoming world.

              I look for inspiration wherever it can be found, and inspiration
              is everywhere.

              I discuss internet technologies a lot within the blog posts of
              this webpage, and after talking about all the things that inspire
              me, and thinking about how many of those things were able to
              inspire me through the internet, I am truly grateful to be around
              in a time where inspiration is more accessible than ever.
