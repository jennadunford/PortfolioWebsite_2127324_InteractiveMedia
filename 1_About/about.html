          <p>
            My name is Jenna, I am a 21 year old Engineering and Digital Arts
            student at the University of the Witwatersrand, welcome to my About
            page.
          </p>
          <p>
            What is there to know about me? I enjoy programming, I can code in
            Assembly, C#, C++ and Javascript. I have experience with making
            games in Unity, mainly 2D games.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love to draw, I would love to someday pursue a career as a
            freelance illustrator. I love to explore the styles of various
            animated shows with my art, I love to use pastel and bright colours
            and I love to draw witches.
          </p>
          <p>
            For all of the games I have made throughout my game design course, I
            have made my own art assets and have animated them as well.

        <h3 class="aboutSubtitle">My Creations and Experience</h3>
        <article>
          <p>
            As part of my engineering degree, I had to progam a microprocesor
            using assembly code, while it was very basic, just programming an
            8-bit LED light to display random numbers, making red and green
            lights flash with button presses, it was still challenging and very
            enjoyable.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have made several games throughout my degree as well, including 2D
            and 3D games, I have experimented with platformers, turn-based
            combat games, physics-based games and exploration games.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can exlore my abilites with regards to web design by taking a
            look at the website before you - which I made myself.
          </p>

            through a selection of my digital artworks.

        <h3 class="aboutSubtitle">My Inspirations</h3>
        <article>
          <p>
            My most important inspirations for my art comes from other artists.
            Akira Toriyama, the artist of Dragon Ball, is one of my favorites. I
            love his environment designs the most, beautiful pre-historic and
            futuristic environments creating these wonderful mystical worlds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another artist I admire is Julia Potts, creator of the cartoon show
            'Summer Camp Island' - I love the whimsical character designs in the
            show, the cute faces that adorn trees, rocks and other environment
            elements. I love the colours of the show and the peace that it
            brings me.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a game designer, I also look to games for inspirations. My
            favorite games include Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing: New
            Horizons, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and Don't Starve.
            I enjoy mainly cosy, peaceful games with beautiful art and gentle
            music. I enjoy Don't Starve for it's creepy Tim-Burton-Esqe art
            direction and for the thrill of the survival element.
          </p>
          <p>
            For insight about my inspirations with regards to my website design,
            please take a look at the Inpirations section of the Design page.
