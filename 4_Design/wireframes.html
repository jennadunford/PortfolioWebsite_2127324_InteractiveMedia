          Comparing Current Site Design to Previous Website
        </h3>
        <article class="oldDiscuss">
          <p>For overall site-wide changes, there are many.</p>
          <ol class="sChanges">
            <li>
              <p>The Colour Palette</p>
              <p>
                I decided that the usage of pink was too overbearing on the site
                as a whole. It seemed too bright for the minamilist aesthetic
                that I was going for, and it made the top navigation bar of the
                site stand out too much. I changed the colour palette to light
                lavender greys and purples, I found this colour much more
                suitable to my chosen minimalist aesthetic. I also chose to keep
                the usage of colour on each page to a minimum.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The Font</p>
              <p>
                I did not like the boldness of the previous font choice, I liked
                that it was readable, but it did not feel minimalist. The font
                looked like it stood out too much, especially when used in
                larger font sizes for headings and titles. I changed to my
                current font style because it was thin and simple and elegant.
                It is readable, but does not take up much space or stand out too
                much.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The Navigation Bar</p>
              <p>
                Initially, I liked the fixed navigation bar on the previous
                website, but in retrospect, it seemed like it took up too much
                space on the webpage, it is quite large and it stands out a lot.
                There is also a lot of distance between the first navigation
                button and the last one, this takes away from my aim of ease of
                user interface. Arranging the new navigation in a 2x3 grid
                allows all of the buttons to be close together and easy to
                reach. The navigation interface now does not have a background
                colour, because I do not want it to take up too much space, but
                it is still visible and clear to the user.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The Logo Removal and Title Change</p>
              <p>
                I found that the logo of the previous webpage did not
                communicate the purpose of the page very well, and the title was
                very generic. I removed the logo because I felt it was not
                necessary and I wanted to communicate minimalism most of all.
                The title is now less words, and is specific to my own
                portfolio.

          <article class="oldDiscuss">
            <p>
              The previous home page was littered with a lot of information,
              there is a pro of the user being able to guage the content of the
              website as a whole, however I was trying to aim for minimalism,
              and I decided that this did not convey the minimalist aesthetic
              that I wanted. For the new home page, there is no extra
              information, it is only a landing page to introduce the user to
              the site with an image and the navigation bar present.

          <h3 class="designSubHeading">The About Page</h3>
          <img

            src="Images/old_aboutPage.jpg"
            alt="screenshot of old website about page"

          <article class="oldDiscuss">
            <p>
              I changed the About page to look more professional for this
              website. I found that there was too much colour on the previous
              about page, there are many elements and they could all be
              distracting to the user. I put my art on the old about page, but
              it was not a page for art, the art page is the page for art. I
              decided that there was no reason for art to be on the about page.
              The about page on this new site contains only information about
              me, there is only text and no blocks of colour, it allows the user
              to only focus on the information that I am presenting to them.

          <article class="oldDiscuss">
            <p>
              While I did like the old art page, I did want to take away the
              pink background, and I also wanted to experiment with metaphor
              design for user interfaces. I love art books and find it a nice
              way to explore the art of my favorite artists, and so I wanted to
              create a virtual art book experience using javascript. While the
              gallery-grid design of the previous art page was good, and might
              be a design I decide to revert back to for future iterations, I
              like the experimentation I did for the new art page and I am happy
              that I changed it from the old design.

          <article class="oldDiscuss">
            <p>
              I kept the blogs page with the list of blogs very similar to the
              previous version, but I did change the colour palette, which I
              found more effective in communicating minimalism. I also added
              descriptions to the different blog listings so that the user could
              see a small preview of what the blog would be about. I also
              decided not to make the different blog listings stretch across the
              entirety of the page, they are still lengthy, but the space is
              utilized more with the description in this new website.

          <article class="oldDiscuss">
            <p>
              I changed the position of the title of the blog posts on the
              individual blog post pages to the position of the title of the
              entire page for the new website. I did this because the title was
              taking up too much space on the previous website. I also removed
              the large "blog post" text because I felt that the user would
              already know that they are on a blog post page, and it was not
              necessary to reiterate that information. I also removed the large
              coloured block on which the blog content sat, and changed it to
              just a white background. This was to be consistent with the rest
              of the site and to further communicate minimalism.

              The previous design page was an embedded pdf document, which,
              while effective, was not very cohesive with the rest of the site
              design. I changed the design page on this new site to a blank page
              with a list of buttons to navigate to the pages that make up the
              style guide. The new style guide is now consistent with the style
              of the rest of the website, all of the information is divided into
              navigable pages, all accessible from the main design page.

          <article class="oldDiscuss">
            <p>
              The old contact page took up a lot of space, but conveyed very
              little information. There is also an example of my artwork on the
              old contact page, but it does not need to be there. I changed the
              different links to social media sites into small blocks with links
              underneath minimal images, so that the page was not too bland. I
              find that pursuing minimalism does not need to make the pages
              boring, and so I added the little image designs to make the page a
              little more interesting and to separate the three contact links. I
              also removed the block of colour that existed on the old page, to
              be consistent with the rest of the site design.
