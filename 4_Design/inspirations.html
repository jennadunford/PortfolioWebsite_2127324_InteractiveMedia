          Design References, Inspirations and Literature
        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>
            In order to design this website I needed to do some research into
            other websites with aesthetics that were similar to the vision that
            I had for this website.
          </p>
          <p>
            These websites were for both inspiration and reference as I made
            various design choices for the website.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also took ideas and notes from the various readings given by the
            Interactive Media courswork. This literature helped to give insight
            into the process of website design, taking into account user
            experience and interface and various methodologies for web design.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will be discussing all of these factors in the content of this
            page.

          <p>
            A common factor I was looking for when researching various portfolio
            websites was minimalism, and so this website stood out
            particularily.
          </p>
          <p>
            I like that there is an image of the person being represented by the
            portfolio, she is right there so that you know whose work you are
            perusing. This was a small inspiration between the drawings of my
            hands on the home page of my website. I wanted to give the user the
            impression that my hands are a representation of myself and what I
            use to create.
          </p>
          <p>
            I like that the headings of the parapraphs are bold and large, even
            if the user does not have time to read the entire paragraph, the
            user can see at first glance what the designer wants you to know.
            This is the portfolio of a creative explorer, you can guage the
            meaning of the following paragraph from this.
          </p>
          <p>
            The colour palette is very minimal, something I wanted to replicate
            in my own website. I like the small pops of colour that are added to
            this site, but I wanted to take my minimalist aesthetic a step
            further and only stick with black.
          </p>
          <p>
            The navigation of the site is hidden as you are on the various
            pages, so that you can focus on the content of each page without
            looking at what else the website has to offer, allowing users to
            experience everything slowly and to take in all of the information.
            I really liked this part of this site.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a beautifully designed website with a wonderful minimalist
            aesthetic, it was very helpful for finding my own design style for
            this website. I am sure you can see some influence in how my bodies
            of text are structured.

          <p>
            Immediately, the minimalism of this site jumped out at me. It is
            extremely simple, but elegant. I can see the name of the person, in
            bold, and then what the person does.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are not a lot of different elements on the page, a lack of
            images and such, this leaves the user to focus on the text, to take
            in the core, valuable information about this portfolio.
          </p>
          <p>
            The colour palette of this site is also small, there are also pops
            of colour for some sub headings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Much like the previous reference, this site was helpful in my design
            process for pages thick with text, such as the individual blog
            pages, the about page, and other design pages.

          <p>
            At this point, you might be thinking that all of these sites are the
            same. Why am I showing all of them to you? I agree that there are
            vast similarities between all these references, but I think this is
            important, because I can pinpoint those very small differences
            between each site and decide what I like and what I do not like, all
            in a very small decision pool. It makes designing and making
            decisions a lot easier.
          </p>
          <p>
            This site is minimalist like the two previous sites, but it has a
            much smaller colour palette. Exclusively black and white. It looks
            professional, it looks elegant. It could have colours, but I can see
            that colours would not add any more substance to the webpage, it
            stands on its own and looks beautiful.
          </p>
          <p>
            I like how the name of the person is in a different font, a code
            related font, it makes it stand out and also tells the user that
            this person is in some kind of software development.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a lot of white space on this webpage, but it works to the
            advantage of the design. The users eyes can drift from each block of
            text with no other distractions. The white space shows that the user
            does not need to be overwhelmed by lots of information at once, the
            emptiness serves a good design purpose. I also wished to use
            emptiness in certain instances on my site.

        <h3 class="aboutSubtitle">Literature Review on Design</h3>
        <article>
          <h4 class="designSubtitle">Metaphor Design for User Interfaces</h4>
          <p>
            This was an extremely interesting paper to read. The main point is
            that it is easier for people to understand user interfaces if they
            have a real life reference for them. For example: we understand how
            files and folders work in windows because we can relate these to
            real-life physical files and folders, we can discern their meaning
            in terms of the design of the windows file manager.
          </p>
          <p>
            This paper inspired me to make a virtual, interactive art portfolio
            book for this website. Users can recognize that I am using the
            metaphor of a book to display my artworks. The user can turn through
            the pages, and navigate through the sections of artworks as if they
            are viewing them in a book.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was very happy with the takeaway I took from this piece of
            literature, and with how I implemented what I learnt into my
            website.
          </p>
          <p>Reference: Marcus. A,"Metaphor Design for User Interfaces",1998</p>
          <h4 class="designSubtitle">
            A Crash Course in User Experience and Interface Design
          </h4>
          <p>
            This piece of literature takes the form of a powerpoint and a
            lecture given by Peta Goldberg.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lecture was extremely insightful in terms of understanding the
            nuances between user experience and interface, and the design
            principles behind them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main takeaway from this lecture were the very basic pieces of
            information about website design. Readability. Thoughtful placement
            of elements. Thinking about the hierarchies of information. Another
            great part was using actual websites and social media applications
            to display these principles in action.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, this lecture and its powerpoint helped me find my footing
            as I approached designing a website from scratch, and the powerpoint
            in question will definitely be something I look to for reference in
            the future.

          Reflection on References, Inspirations, and the Literature
        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>
            Compared to the previous version of this portfolio, I took more time
            with the references and literature in order to design this website,
            and I think that it paid off.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without the websites referenced, I do not think I would have been
            able to find a pleasing style for this website, and I am very happy
            that I did manage to find one, at least in my opinion.
          </p>
          <p>
            The two pieces of literature that I reviewed were amazing in helping
            me find a design process for this website. I did read other pieces
            given to us by the courswork, however I do consider these two pieces
            to be the most influential in terms of my work on this website.
