        <h3 class="aboutSubtitle">The Experience of Building a Website</h3>
        <article>
          <p>
            So, websites are an extremely important part of life and society
            today. Websites are are avenues for communication, work, school,
            shopping, learning, discovering, sharing, publishing, entertainment,
            and probably a hundred thousand other things. And within all of
            these millions of websites and billions of webpages, there now
            exists a very own website of my own.
          </p>
          <p>
            I by no means believe that I am an experienced web designer now, in
            fact I am far from it. But, I have learnt a lot about a very
            important part of the internet. When I visit websites now, I find
            myself contemplating how certain things were achieved, I even find
            myself checking out the html of the pages, the javascript, when I
            want to understand how something works. I have learnt how to build a
            website, and I think that my website looks pretty good.
          </p>
          <p>
            The original focus for me was learning how to do things, but I have
            also discovered a new way to express myself, a new way to present
            myself online. I have experienced the ability to express myself
            through these lines of code, I have been able to make decisions and
            enact them at the very core of how a website works. What was my
            experience of building a website? It was a wonderful one. This
            design page, the style guide, has allowed me to reflect a lot on the
            all the small parts of this experience, and it has been fun,
            wonderful, and enlightening.

        <h3 class="aboutSubtitle">Reflections on Changes</h3>
        <article>
          <p>
            On the subject of changes, referencing the website published for the
            previous assignment, the changes have been monumental. For this
            assignment, I really tried to delve into the deepness and importance
            of all the design elements that create a website, and I think that
            all that delving paid off. I am much, much happier with this website
            than I was with the previous one. The last website made me happy but
            it also felt like it was a dabble in web design at best, but this
            website feels like I succeeded in making a proper website, in a way.
            I am very pleased with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, what changed? Everything. I changed absolutely everything. I
            started from scratch for this assignment. I changed the layout of
            the pages, I changed the navigation interface, I changed the
            colours, I changed how the art was displayed. I made these changes
            because I looked at the entirety of the first website and thought to
            myself: "I know I can do better." I actually had pretty much the
            same aims for this website as the first one, but I feel as if I have
            executed those aims effectively for this assignment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why do I feel I have executed the aims more effectively this time? I
            hope you have picked that up from all of the content in the design
            section of the website, I much more confidence in my reasonings, I
            have so much more to say in terms of my design. I believe that I can
            say with confidence that I have improved since the previous
            assignment, and I hope that I can continue to improve further.

          A Personal View of my Webpage and my Growth as a Designer
        </h3>
        <article>
          <p>
            Personally, reflecting on the design of the website, on everything I
            have discussed about the design, I feel as though this website
            represents myself as a designer and an artist. This website is a
            better representation of me than the previous one.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think that I learnt more from the references I used for this
            website, I put a lot more thought into the layout of content in
            terms of the html, I learnt how to program navigation and my art
            portfolio using javascript.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think that I have developed a better sense of user experience and
            interface and their design principles. I think I have managed to
            engage with my design of the UX and UI effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            And with that, I conclude the reflection section of the design guide
            of this website, and I also conclude the design guide of this
            website as a whole. Thank you for reading.
