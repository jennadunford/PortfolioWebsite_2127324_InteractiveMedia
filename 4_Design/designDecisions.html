          The Title, Subtitles, and Navigation Table

            <li class="decisionTableItem">
              The title describes the purpose of the site, and who it is for. By
              Jenna. The website is by Jenna, the portfolio contains works by
              Jenna. I find it is a simple and effective title for a portfolio
              website. It contains my name, and with just two letters it
              describes the purpose of the website.
            </li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">Title font</li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">
              The font is Gill Sans, the same font applied to the entire
              website, all of the fonts are the same for consistency.
            </li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">Title size</li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">
              The main website title is large, but not bold, it is there to
              communicate the title of the website to the user, but it does not
              stand out, this is because it does not need to. It is meant to be
              glanced at, understood and then moved on from.
            </li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">Page Description</li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">
              The page description for each page is placed directly under the
              title, to let the user know the purpose and content of the page
              that they have arrived at.
            </li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">Page Description Size</li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">
              The page description is smaller than the title, this is to convey
              that this a small piece of text for the user to read. It is not a
              subtitle, just a description.
            </li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">Subtitle Placement</li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">
              After reading the description of the page, the user can view the
              subtitle - which is the name of the page that they have arrived
              at. The user already has information about the page that they are
              on from the description above, so the title of the page adds some
              extra information for the user.
            </li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">Subtitle Size</li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">
              The subtitle is large, almost the same size as the website title,
              to communicate to the user that this is a title.
            </li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">Subtitle Font</li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">
              Consistent with the font for the rest of the website.
            </li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">Navigation Table Layout</li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">
              The navigation table is laid out in a 2x3 grid. This is so that it
              takes up a small amount of space on the webpage. All of the
              buttons are close together so that they are all easily accessible
              from one another.
            </li>

              Navigation Button Colour and Hover Colour
            </li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">
              The navigation button backgrounds are a lavender grey, this is a
              light colour, it does not pop out too much. When the navigation
              buttons are hovered over, they turn black, this is to communicate
              to the user that they are clickable. This is the same for all
              clickable links and buttons on the website, save for the buttons
              to reach the blogs, which are a dark purple and turn white when
              hovered over, this is just to distinguish them from the other
              buttons on the website, they serve the purpose of reaching blog
              posts, different from other links.
            </li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">Navigation Fonts and Font Sizes</li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">
              The font is consistent with the rest of the website, the
              navigation button text size is smaller than the title sizes, but
              large enough to be visible and readable by the user.
            </li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">Text Layout</li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">
              For sections of the site with lots of text, the text size is
              smaller, so that paragraphs do not take up too much space, but the
              text is still at a readable size. Text is placed in the middle of
              the page - communicating to the user that it is important content,
              and so it takes center stage.
            </li>

              Navigation Button Colour Change when on Page
            </li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">
              For the main pages on the website: The home page, about page, blog
              home page, design page, contact page and art page - the colour of
              the navigation button for that respective page is set to stay at
              the colours it becomes when hovered over on other pages. This is
              another way to communicate to the user which page they are
              currently on.

            <li class="decisionTableItem">Lack of Content on Home Page</li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">
              The lack of content is meant to communicate an aesthetic of
              minimalism for the entire site. I also did not want to overwhelm
              the user with too many elements or information. I want the user to
              only understand what the website is for when they reach the home
              page and be presented with the various pages that they can
              navigate to.

              The about page only has the colours of the ever-present navigation
              bar, and then black text on a white background. This to
              communicate an aesthetic of minimalism, and to allow the user to
              only focus on the text of the page. The text is laid out in a
              logical format, with titles and then paragraphs of information.

            <li class="decisionTableItem">
              This is a short description just to communicate what the content

              Fading and Changing Multiple First Subtitle Texts
            </li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">
              The first sub-heading always begins with the words 'I am' because
              the first paragraph is describing myself and the things that I do,
              and so multiple headings beginning with "I am" is appropriate to
              communicate this. The multiple headings is powered by the Slick.js
              library that allows it to fade and loop between each of the ways I
              would describe myself professionally. This shows the user that I
              have multiple skills and abilities.

              Inspirations
            </li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">
              Each of these sub headings begin with the word "my" to communicate
              that this page contains all information about myself. I chose to
              write a small description about myself to introduce myself to the
              user, I wanted to discuss the things I make for a bit and then
              also talk about my inspirations behind my creations.

            <li class="decisionTableItem">About Page Sub Headings Font Size</li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">
              The sub headings are large to communicate to the user that they
              are titles of a sort, describing the paragraph below them.
            </li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">About Page Article font Size</li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">
              The font size of the paragraph is small, so that the paragraphs do
              not take up too much space, but they are large enough to be
              legible.
            </li>

            <li class="decisionTableItem">Technical Creations Carousel</li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">
              The technical creations carousel is there to allow the user to go
              through three different technical projects that showcase the
              different languages and technologies I am familiar with. The
              choice to do this in a carousel, powered by slick.js, is because I
              did not want the different project descriptions to take up too
              much space on the webpage, to allow the user to flip through the
              different projects as if it is a brochure, and to keep this
              mini-technical portfolio looking small and professional for the
              user. The carousel also communicates a nice minimalist design,
              which is one of the main aesthetic aims for this website.
            </li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">Inspirations Carousel</li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">
              The inspirations carousel, powered by slick.js, allows the user to
              go through the various inspirations that inspire my work. The
              layout and design of this is very similar to the technical
              creations carousel, and so it also contains much of the same
              reasoning. One difference is that this carousel uses a fading
              effect as opposed to a flipping effect on the technical creations
              carousel, this is because the inspirations carousel showcases
              something more personal and not as professional, and I found that
              the fading effect between the slides allows for a softer, more
              welcoming approach to displaying the information as opposed to a
              more technical and professional approach, as seen in the technical
              creations carousel.

              details. Users can "flip" through the pages using arrow keys or
              the buttons on the interface. I chose to use an interactive
              virtual art book to engage with metaphor design for user
              interfaces.

              The pages of the virtual portfolio are a lavender grey, to show
              that the portfolio is its own entity on the page, but the colour

              navigation interface for users to browse through the various

              drawn to the title of just one section, they do not need to flip
              through the entire book to get to it, they can merely click to
              directly navigate to that section.

              The art portfolio contains sections of text that describes the

              In the immediate previous version of this website, there was a
              title for the table of contents, this was removed because the
              contents buttons that are displayed are self explanatory for the
              user, and because the table of contents title did take up a bit of
              unnecessary space on the page, which goes against the miniminalist
              aim of the website's aesthetic.

              In the immediate previous version of this website, the images in
              the artbook would increase in size when hovered over, this was
              removed as it interferred with the page turning effect given by
              turn.js, and it made the elements in the artbook a bit jittery.
              The images on their own are effective enough to show the user my
              abilities without the need for an increase in size on hover.

              blog content itself exists within paragraphs, the font size is
              small but large enough to read so that it does not take up too

              button, because there is no blog post preceeding it, and the final
              blog post does not have a next button, as there is no blog post
              after it.

              In the immediate previous version of this website, there were
              borders surrounding the contact details, this was removed, as it
              seemed unnecessary because the contact details are already in a
              tabular format, and so their separation is already communicated to
              the user without the need for borders separating them. Removing
              the borders aligns with the minimalism philosophy for this
              website, with calls for the removal of any unnecessary elements.

            <li class="decisionTableItem">
              The font chosen is Gill Sans, this is because it is a simple,
              elegant font, it is not too bold or distracting, it fits in well
              with the minimalist site design. It is also legible.
            </li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">The Colours</li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">
              The colours are a selection of light purples, black and white - I
              chose purple because it is a feminine colour, but it is not the
              generic feminine colour of pink, I wanted to communicate my
              femininity in the site, but not to make it a core feature of the
              site, I do not want the user to think about it too much. The
              colours are also muted - nearly grey - so that they do not
              distract the user too much.
            </li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">The General Aesthetic</li>
            <li class="decisionTableItem">
              The general aesthetic is minimalism because I enjoy minimalism as
              an aesthetic when I visit other websites, it is a nice way to
              present information without overwhelming the user, and it allows
              for an elegant site design without too many elements.
